# Window Capture
this is libbary in c++ that brings together glfw, glad, imgui, and open cv for the ultimate window capture template. basicly my libbary just brings them all to gether glad for opengl glfw for the window and finnaly opencv for window iterpretation
# things you can do
- Get every frame from a window
- Interpret/Minipulate the frames with opencv
- Show them in a glfw window
- Use imgui for the user to change settings
# How to use
all you have to do is run the build script bash or batch they to they same thing (clear the screen & build) you can also just build i prefer typing build if your on linux tho i would assume you cant use dll files and i wasnt trynna find all of those a files beacuse most of the libbarys did not include them on thier github pages
